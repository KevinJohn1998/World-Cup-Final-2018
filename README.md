# World-Cup-Final-2018

This is my first project where in i explore the 2018 world cup data set 

The main objects were 

1.) analyse which player had the greatest number of passes in the final 

2.) analyse which player had the greatest number of passes throught the whole competition 



## Task 1

Playmakers in a team usually play as mid-feilders. They have an important role to ochestrate every 
aspect of the game. Teams benefit greatly from players who can distribute the ball effectively. Likewise we 
see that Croatia had two such amazing players - Ivan Rakitic and Luka Modric. We can see in the figure below that both these players had significant number of ball touches in the game. Ivan seemed to be the leader in this pool. Although we cannot detremine a direct casuality it is important to note that Luka Modric was nominated with Golden Ball award. Thus emphasising the importance of having such players in your side
