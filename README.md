1.) analyse which player had the greatest number of passes in the final 

2.) analyse which player had the greatest number of passes throught the whole competition 



## TASK 1

Playmakers in a team usually play as mid-feilders. They have an important role to ochestrate every 
aspect of the game. Teams benefit greatly from players who can distribute the ball effectively. Likewise we 
see that Croatia had two such amazing players - Ivan Rakitic and Luka Modric. We can see in the figure below that both these players had significant number ball touches in the game
